Overview
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA, https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp) is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. phenotypes). In our study, GSEA software (v.4.1) (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) was used to obtain NE score (NES) (Figure 3f). 

Details
The dataset is the dataset of mice, which has two groups of renal cells from PKD mice (group KM, n=9) and ccRCC mice (group KMS, n=5). The details for sample preparation and data acquisition can be found in our publication. We uploaded data files to GSEA tool following the instructions in help page. Here, we imported gene Expression Data, Phenotype Data and Gene Set Database to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Relevent data were uploaded:
• mRNA_Expression Data.gct
• mRNA_Phenotype Data.cls
• mRNA_Gene Set Database.chip
Processing parameters were set as following:
• Expression dataset: Gene Expression Data.gct
• Gene sets database: Gene matrix c2.cp.kegg.v2022
• Number of permutations: 1000
• Phenotype labels: Protein Phenotype Data.cls KMS_versus_KM
• Permutation type: phenotype
• Chip platform: Gene Set Database.chip

Analysis results
Tables of NE score (NES) for each pathway were generated. The processed data, serving as the foundation for NES panels, have been uploaded into the Source Data. 

Visualizing
The GraphPad Prism software v8.4.2.679 was utilized to display P value and NE score in dot plot (Figure 3f).
