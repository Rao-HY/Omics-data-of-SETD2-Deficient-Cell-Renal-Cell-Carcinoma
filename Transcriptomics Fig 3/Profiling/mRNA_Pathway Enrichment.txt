Overview
In our study, the GO/KEGG enrichment analysis was executed using R software package clusterProfiler (version: v.4.5.0) through Hiplot Pro (https://hiplot.com.cn/), a comprehensive web service for biomedical data analysis and visualization. 

Details
The dataset is the dataset of mice, which has two groups of renal cells from PKD mice (group KM, n=5) and ccRCC mice (group KMS, n=5). Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) raw data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GEO: GSE221136. The details for sample preparation and data acquisition can be found in our publication.
