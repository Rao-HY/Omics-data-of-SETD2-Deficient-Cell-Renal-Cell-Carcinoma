Overview
In our study, the GO/KEGG enrichment analysis was executed using R software package clusterProfiler (version: v.4.5.0) through Hiplot Pro (https://hiplot.com.cn/), a comprehensive web service for biomedical data analysis and visualization. 

Details
The dataset is the dataset of mice, which has two groups of renal cells from PKD mice (group KM, n=9) and ccRCC mice (group KMS, n=5). Protomics raw data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with dataset identifier PXD038966. The details for sample preparation and data acquisition can be found in our publication.
