A spectral library will be created from the DIA runs and used to reanalyse them; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first step
Highly heuristic protein grouping will be used, to reduce the number of protein groups obtained; this mode is recommended for benchmarking protein ID numbers; use with caution for anything else
When generating a spectral library, in silico predicted spectra will be retained if deemed more reliable than experimental ones
Fixed-width center of each elution peak will be used for quantification
Interference removal from fragment elution curves disabled
Exclusion of fragments shared between heavy and light peptides from quantification is not supported in FASTA digest mode - disabled; to enable, generate an in silico predicted spectral library and analyse with this library

DIA-NN 1.8.1 (Data-Independent Acquisition by Neural Networks)
Compiled on Apr 14 2022 15:31:19
Current date and time: Fri Nov 18 01:55:51 2022
CPU: AuthenticAMD AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X 32-Core Processor
SIMD instructions: AVX AVX2 FMA SSE4.1 SSE4.2 SSE4a 
Logical CPU cores: 32
Thread number set to 32
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
N-terminal methionine excision enabled
In silico digest will involve cuts at K*,R*
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 1
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
A spectral library will be created from the DIA runs and used to reanalyse them; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first step
Highly heuristic protein grouping will be used, to reduce the number of protein groups obtained; this mode is recommended for benchmarking protein ID numbers; use with caution for anything else
When generating a spectral library, in silico predicted spectra will be retained if deemed more reliable than experimental ones
DIA-NN will optimise the mass accuracy automatically using the first run in the experiment. This is useful primarily for quick initial analyses, when it is not yet known which mass accuracy setting works best for a particular acquisition scheme.
